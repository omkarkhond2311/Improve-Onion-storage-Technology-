# 🧅 Improved Onion Storage Technology

## 📌 Problem Statement
A large quantity of onions is lost after harvesting due to improper storage conditions, uncontrolled temperature, humidity, and ethylene gas exposure. This leads to rotting, sprouting, and price instability.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A smart IoT-based onion storage system using sensors, automation, and a real-time dashboard to monitor and control temperature, humidity, and ethylene levels. The system is low-cost, scalable, and solar powered.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- IoT Sensors
- Temperature & Humidity Sensors
- Ethylene Detection
- Automation System
- Solar Power
- Dashboard Monitoring

## 🎯 Impact & Benefits
- Reduction in post-harvest losses
- Increased farmer income
- Stable market prices
- Improved onion quality
- Support for rural and agri-tech development
